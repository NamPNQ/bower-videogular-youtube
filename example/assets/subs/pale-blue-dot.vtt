00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.310
From this distant vantage point

2
00:00:18.334 --> 00:00:22.351
the earth, might not seem of any particular interest.

3
00:00:23.861 --> 00:00:26.461
But for us, it's different.

4
00:00:26.471 --> 00:00:29.281
Considering again that dot

5
00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:33.447
thats here, thats home, thats us.

6
00:00:33.457 --> 00:00:38.868
On it everyone you love, everyone you know

7
00:00:38.878 --> 00:00:40.573
everyone you ever heard of,

8
00:00:40.583 --> 00:00:43.090
every human being who ever was,

9
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.376
lived out their lives.

10
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.474
The aggregate of our joy and suffering

11
00:00:49.612 --> 00:00:53.443
thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines,

12
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.160
every hunter and forager,

13
00:00:56.926 --> 00:01:00.966
every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization,

14
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.869
every king and peasant,

15
00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.527
every young couple in love,

16
00:01:05.537 --> 00:01:07.348
every mother and father,

17
00:01:07.839 --> 00:01:08.907
hopeful child,

18
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.438
inventor and explorer,

19
00:01:11.903 --> 00:01:14.759
every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician,

20
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.194
every superstar, every supreme leader,

21
00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:22.524
every saint and sinner in the history of our species

22
00:01:22.534 --> 00:01:28.943
lived there, on a mote of dust, suspended in a sunbeam.
